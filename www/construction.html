<h3>Jobs to Avoid</h3>
<dt>Job Title:</dt><dd>Construction or hotel worker</dd>
<dt>Job Location:</dt><dd>USA</dd>
<dt>Job Description:</dt>
<p>
Legitimate jobs in hotels and construction are offered with the promise of a better life in the USA. Applicants are told that all immigration and labor laws will be followed.
</p>
<p>
Reality is that traffickers use false information to obtain false work visas for you and the threat of deportation is used to keep you working for them as a slave.
</p><p>
Because you have an illegal work visa you have no choice except to pay exorbitant rent to live in barely furnished apartments that "ensure you cannot make enough money to repay their debt, buy a plane ticket home or pay your own living expenses in the US." You also have to pay for transportation to your jobs, uniform fees and other fees that often leaves you with paychecks with negative earnings.
</p><p>
You are threatened with physical harm, deportation or other legal problems if you don't comply. You are not allowed to receive mail.
