<h3>Jobs to Avoid</h3>
<dt>Job Title:</dt><dd>Maid/Housekeeper</dd>
<dt>Job Location:</dt><dd>UK, Saudi Arabia</dd>
<dt>Job Description:</dt>
<p>
Jobs as maids and housekeepers to wealthy households are offered with the promise of a better life in the UK and Saudi Arabia. Applicants are told that all immigration and labor laws will be followed.

Reality is that traffickers sieze all your identity papers before smuggling you into the country. The threat of deportation is used to keep you working for them as a slave.
</p><p>
Because you have no legal status, you have no choice except to stay in overcrowded, barely furnished rooms and work in whatever way your landlord demands, often including being sexually abused.
</p><p>
You are threatened with physical harm, deportation or prison if you don't comply. You are not allowed any outside contact of any sort.
